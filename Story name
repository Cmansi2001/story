 which often has uplifting, encouraging, and positive messages, allowing the viewer to feel good inside! They created Doodle Me Alive, their artwork website, which focuses on affirmations, cute illustrations and trans liberation. Typography is the art of arranging letters, and is seen on screens, paper, and signs all around us. With typography you can change the look and feel of words or phrases by using different styles of letters to say different things. Like people, they have different personalities. For example, thick bold lines can be loud and thin cursive lines are soft and quiet. How we present these words becomes just as much a part of the message as the words themselves. In this activity, we are using different mediums that can be used in typography, such as stamps, stickers, magazine cut outs and letter drawing. Like Jae, we will use our voices to put a positive message out into the world!
